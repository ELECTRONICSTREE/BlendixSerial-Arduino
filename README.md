# blendixserial Arduino Library

The blendixserial library is designed to work in conjunction with the blendixserial addon in Blender. It allows you to transfer 3D coordinates (either integer or floating point) from Arduino to Blender, as well as receive and process coordinates sent from Blender to Arduino. This library offers functions to configure the coordinate type, set and reset coordinates, send text information along with coordinates, and parse received data..
